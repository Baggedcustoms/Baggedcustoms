Thanks to him we no longer have to mess with trainers when we go to attach vehicles or objects to the Trailer. Simply stroll to the rear and you will get a popup to hit \"X\" to lower the ramps. Then as you load you will be presented with the option to attach the item you load on the Trailer with an \"X\". I cant tell you what a pleasure it has been working with Mental on this project. Mental is a great asset to the community and look forward to doing many more mods with him.
